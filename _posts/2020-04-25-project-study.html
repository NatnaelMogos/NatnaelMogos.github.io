<p>
In the natural sciences machine learning is establishing as a promising way to overcome costly calculations of large amount of data often dealt with. Especially powerful for small data sets, Gaussian process regression is a suitable approach with the benefit that it provides uncertainty measurements, which has been used for geometry optimization, prediction of redox potentials, fitting potential energy surfaces to name a few.

In recent work, by Bahlke et al., GPR models with different descriptor and kernel combinations were built to predict exchange coupling constants. In this work, some of the descriptor and kernel combinations were used for model building, to investigate their performance on different data sets and for different molecular properties. The molecular structures and corresponding properties, used to build the machine learning models, were obtained from the QM9 data set, which has been utilized extensively to predict a variety of molecular properties.

The learnability of dipole moments and isotropic polarizabilities was investigated by training GPR models using a Mat√©rn, periodic (Exp-Sine-Squared) and a radial-basis function kernel. Further, linear models were trained and the prediction performances were calculated and compared. For the GPR models as well as the linear models the Coulomb matrix, many-body descriptors and the many-body tensor representation descriptor were used as data representation.
