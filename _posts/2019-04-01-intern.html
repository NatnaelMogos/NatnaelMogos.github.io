<p>
With recent advances in experimental techniques in atom-sized contact engineering, molecular-scale electronic circuits have become a realistic goal. To support experiments and further theoretical advances, it is mandatory to derive models to describe charge transport in nanostructures.

<p>
The Greens function approach can be used to approximate the transmission of electrons through molecular junctions. Here, we calculate the electrode Greens functions for gold clusters using DFT as implemented in Turbomole. The local density of states (LDOS) around the Fermi energy can be considered constant for gold. Therefore, the notoriously expensive ab initio calculation for molecular junctions can be performed using the wide band limit.
