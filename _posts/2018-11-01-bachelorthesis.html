<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>Within this work copper nanocubes were synthesized with sizes of 200 nm and 1,4 Î¼m, depend-
ing on reaction condition and substrate. With regard to the average size and size distribution of the particles the synthesis was examined at different reaction temperatures. Moreover a change in the morphology and topography of the particle at the different reaction temperatures was char-
acterized over time. The synthesis was extended with palladium as well as platinum with the aim of synthesizing alloy particle. The synthesized particles were examined vie scanning electron mi-
croscopy. The alloy particles were additionally examined via scanning transmission electron mi-
croscopy in combination with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy with regard to composition of the particles. The phases of the synthesized particles were analyzed via X-ray diffraction. The
performed reactions constitute a precharacterisation for future in situ ptychography experiments. </p>
