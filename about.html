<p>Throughout the course of my degree I have worked on projects in theoretical chemistry and theoretical 
physics, where I was curious to explore the nature of molecules and their properties through 
computational methods. My passion for machine learning and AI led me to dedicate the last two years 
towards applying these technologies to the chemical compound space. </p> 

<p class="mb-5"> Due to the interdisciplinary 
nature of my degree, I gained valuable insights into scientific programming projects and approaches 
to cross disciplinary problem solving. I had the great opportunity to work on exciting scientific AI 
projects in collaboration with scientists from the University of Hamburg, GÃ¶ttingen, and Zurich. </p>
